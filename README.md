# bsky-random-places

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) bot that posts a random image from Street View at
a predefined schedule.

## Development

You will need to provide the botâ€™s username, app password, Maps API key and
signing secret through environment variables:

```
BSKY_RANDOM_PLACES_USERNAME
BSKY_RANDOM_PLACES_PASSWORD
BSKY_RANDOM_PLACES_MAPS_KEY
BSKY_RANDOM_PLACES_MAPS_SECRET
```

Then build with `yarn build` and deploy by running the `bin.mjs` file in `dist`.

## Licence
